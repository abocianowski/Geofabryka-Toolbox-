Geofabryka ToolBox is a set of tools supporting digitization, modification and creation of new polygon elements.
The plug-in consists of four tools:
- Cut elements,
- Add Buffer,
- Fill the empty spaces,
- Attributes join by line

Each of the above tools requires the same coordinate system for the modified layers.
Each of the tools is described below:

### - Cut elements

The tool enables cutting out the common part from selected layers and saving it to the target layer. Topological points at the intersections will be added to each layer.

The common part was cut from layers 1 and 2, then saved in the target layer (layer 3):
